https://thawing-chamber-99958.herokuapp.com/v1/world <br/>
https://thawing-chamber-99958.herokuapp.com/v2/national <br/>
https://thawing-chamber-99958.herokuapp.com/v2/world <br/>

# Instructions

If you want to play with this API locally simply clone it, cd into it, and run
the following commands into your terminal:

$ bundle install <br/>
$ rake db:create <br/>
$ rake db:migrate <br/>
$ rake db:seed <br/>

# Tests

The tests are located in the spec folder. If you wish to run the tests
type rspec into your terminal. The tests will initially fail because your test
database is not seeded. <br/>

In the terminal Run: <br/>
rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test </br>

Then rerun rspec in your terminal. The tests should not be passing.
